## Project 1
### Quote Generator

For the first project, I will be starting with a simple quote generation app. I will select a number of famous quotes and display them to the page. These quotes will update along with the person it originated from along with a source and date if known. Quotes can be cycled manually with the button, otherwise they will cycle through naturally on a timer. Finally, the background color for the page will update based on the subject matter: red for love, brown for history, green for money, etc.
