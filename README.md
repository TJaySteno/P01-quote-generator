## Project 1
### [Random Quote Generator](https://tjaysteno.github.io/P01-quote-generator/ "See it now")

For my first Tech Degree project, I have created a simple quote generation app. It selects one out of a number of famous quotes and displays it to the page. Quotes can be cycled manually by clicking a button, otherwise they will cycle through on a timer. Finally, the background color for the page will update based on the subject matter: red for love, brown for history, green for money, etc.
